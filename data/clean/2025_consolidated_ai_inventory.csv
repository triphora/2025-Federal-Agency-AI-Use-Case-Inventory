There remain significant gaps in the understanding of how the catalyst's atomistic structure determines the activity of reactions and how it is transiently transformed under varying operating conditions. The proposed effort seeks to take on this challenge with a data-science-driven approach to computational modeling, joining it with advanced experimental methods of characterization to create new methods for capturing realistic complexity of reactions at heterogenous and disordered interfaces. As a prototype application, we will focus on the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) CO + H2O â†’ CO2 +H2, as carried out over an active oxide (ceria CeO2) supported nanoscale Pt cluster catalyst. The Pt/CeO2 system is a high activity, low temperature catalyst for WGSR in which transient catalyst reconstructions and fluxional oscillating behavior of active sites at the metal-support interface play an essential role.","The understanding of catalytic reactions has been a long-standing challenge due to the complexity and wide range of time scales involved in their mechanisms.

These foodborne outbreaks require cooperative efforts from CDC staff, FDA, USDA, and local agencies and the AI system is used through a centralized data platform System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (also known as SEDRIC). For more information on SEDRIC, please go to our website: https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne-outbreaks/php/foodsafety/tools/index.html","SEDRIC's AIP use case provides CDC epidemiologists the ability to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks by more effectively leveraging data available in a rich data source, such as receipts from grocery stores, that otherwise requires extensive time and human effort to parse through. In addition, this workflow would free up epidemiologists' time and, potentially, increase the frequency with which both CDC and STLT partners could utilize shopper card, receipts, and free text responses to support investigations. There are two main expected benefits from this use case. The first addresses manually entering receipt information, shopper card information, or other such free text field is traditionally error prone and time intensive for a variety of information. This AI system provides a human-in-the-loop opportunity to review and update data entry points while reducing time spent by staff to gain these insights. Having a set structured output as well increased standardization of this information and eases reporting in situations requiring cooperation from multiple organizations. The second benefit revolves around using the summarization capability, the extensive process of mapping common names of different food items is done automatically, greatly reducing the human labor time to generate dashboards of information regarding current foodborne investigations to serve as a decision point to aid in outbreak response.","The Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) available within SEDRIC provides CDC epidemiologists the power to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks.

NCHS conducts national surveys and releases microdata (data containing information about individuals) for public use. To protect survey participants confidentiality, statistical disclosure limitation techniques have been used to de-identify data, but these methods have drawbacks of losing statistical properties of the original data and thus limiting useful analyses. Additionally, these methods are not designed for very large data or text data. 

Use of synthetic data may offer another option. The goal of synthetic data is to preserve essential statistical features and variable relationships of the original data such that statistical inference based on the synthetic data is close to that of the original data. 

Large language models (LLMs) may be able to address limitations of statistical methods for synthetic data creation, especially for natural language data. We aim to advance knowledge of this application of LLMs to enable staff to select the optimal tools for synthetic data generation.","Current statistical methods for synthetic data generation have drawbacks such as difficulty handling very large datasets, steep learning curve for people with less statistics or coding background, and inability to generate natural language data.

When a single patient has more than one strain of the same pathogen (e.g. two pathogenic E. coli), the pieces of the DNA fingerprint get mixed together in the sample and make the data unusable for outbreak surveillance. Our ML-based method is intended to sort the pieces of the DNA fingerprints into separate strains and make this data usable for foodborne outbreak surveillance.","Surveillance for diarrheal foodborne outbreaks currently depends upon the availability of bacterial isolates obtained from patient stools to obtain the pathogen ""genomic fingerprints"" identifying pathogen strains. The availability of these isolates for fingerprinting is declining nationwide due to technological advancements that improve patient care. To maintain our ability to detect outbreaks without isolates, CDC is developing laboratory methods that obtain the pathogen genomic fingerprint directly from the patient stool specimen. However, patient stools frequently contain more than one strain of pathogen, so the ability to deploy these methods and maintain the sensitivity of foodborne outbreak surveillance is dependent upon development of this ML-based method to sort pathogen genomic fingerprint pieces from stool. Based on FoodNet data, we estimate that failure to implement these methods could lead to the loss of up to 75% of the samples currently captured by surveillance for some pathogens. Fewer surveillance samples will mean fewer outbreaks are detected and it will take longer to detect them, resulting in more people affected. For a sense of the scale of the challenge, NORS recorded ~300 outbreaks of Salmonella and E. coli in 2023 that were detected as a result of isolate-based surveillance.

Data abstractors in state health departments across the U.S. abstract relevant information about each death from CME and LE reports, creating narratives that describe the most notable circumstances that contributed to the deaths captured in the system. Thus, much of the valuable contextual information about these deaths, such as details about chronic pain, interpersonal arguments, or other contributing factors, is embedded in free-text narratives and is not routinely abstracted into structured quantitative data fields. Manually extracting this information is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to variability. The problem we are addressing with AI is the automated extraction of specific circumstance information from these unstructured narratives, enabling more comprehensive and systematic data analysis.","Automating the extraction of circumstance information from NVDRS narratives using AI brings several important benefits. First, it significantly reduces the time required to process narrative data. While manual abstraction is resource-intensive and can take hours or days to review thousands of records, AI can accomplish this task in a matter of minutes. This efficiency is especially critical given the scale of the challenge: the NVDRS captures data on over 70,000 violent deaths annually, making manual analysis of detailed free-text information in the CME and LE narratives for each of these incidents impractical. In addition to saving time, AI improves data quality and consistency by applying uniform criteria across all records, which helps to minimize human error and variability. Furthermore, by extracting additional details, such as information about chronic pain or the presence of arguments, AI enhances the surveillance capabilities of public health officials. This richer data enables a better understanding of risk factors and circumstances surrounding violent deaths, which in turn informs more effective prevention strategies. Collectively, these outcomes directly support CDCs mission to strengthen public health surveillance, guide prevention efforts, and ultimately reduce the incidence of violent deaths.","The AI system produces structured data outputs derived from the free-text narratives in the NVDRS. For each narrative, the system identifies and extracts predefined circumstance categories (e.g., presence of chronic pain, evidence of an argument, substance use) and outputs them as structured variables (e.g., binary indicators, extracted text snippets, or coded categories). These outputs can be integrated into existing NVDRS datasets, enabling further quantitative analysis and reporting.",,,,,"The AI system produces structured data outputs derived from the free-text narratives in the NVDRS.

Program officers must actively accept the assignment or refer the application to a more appropriate program officer, and they have full discretion to ignore or override the AI tools recommendations. The systems output is therefore not a principal basis for any legal or binding decision; it is one of several informational inputs to an internal workflow choice made by human staff.
Second, all funding and programmatic decisions are made through established peer review and programmatic processes, governed by existing NIH/NIGMS policies and human judgment. Final funding decisions are made by the NIGMS Director in consultation with the NIGMS Advisory Council, the NIGMS Deputy Director, and the NIGMS Division Directors, not the individual program officers who manage the applications.

Existing commercial AI solutions cannot access USCIS-specific documents and data, cannot be customized to immigration-specific workflows, and pose data security risks. Staff spend significant time on tasks that AI could assist with—such as legal research, document drafting, language translation, code generation, and regulatory compliance checks—but have no approved internal AI capability. Additionally, different organizational roles have vastly different AI assistance needs (e.g., attorneys need legal citations; developers need code; contracting officers need FAR guidance, budget officers need access to sensitive internal fiscal data), requiring a solution that adapts to the user's function rather than providing generic responses. PAiTH will also promote USCIS innovation by enabling testing of a variety of large language models and AI platforms, while informing approaches on prompt generation, cost containment and workforce literacy.","The purpose of PAiTH is to provide USCIS employees with an internal, secure AI assistant that delivers role-specific support for knowledge work tasks. The system will offer six persona-based assistants aligned to core USCIS job functions, each trained and prompted to provide relevant, accurate responses for that role's responsibilities. 
Intended benefits of PAiTH include: Increased Efficiency: Staff can quickly obtain research, draft language, translations, and technical guidance without manual searching through documents or external research; Role-Specific Accuracy: Persona-based responses tailored to each user's organizational function (legal, contracting, development, etc.) provide more relevant and useful outputs than generic AI; Data Security and Compliance: Internal deployment protects PII and sensitive USCIS data while maintaining compliance with federal security and privacy requirements; Controlled Access to USCIS Knowledge: AI can leverage USCIS-specific documents, policies, and data sources that are inaccessible to commercial AI tools, keeping sensitive information within USCIS boundaries; Standardization: Consistent AI-assisted workflows across the agency reduce variability in research and drafting quality; and Cost Savings: Reduces time spent on routine knowledge tasks, allowing staff to focus on complex decision-making and judgment-based work.","PAiTH will generate text-based outputs customized to the user's organizational persona: Legal Persona: Legal research summaries, statute and regulation citations (INA, CFR), case law analysis, draft legal memoranda outlines, document summaries with legal issue identification; Contracts Persona: Market research summaries, FAR/HSAR regulatory guidance, acquisition planning support, vendor comparison analyses, contract language suggestions; Language Translation Persona: Text-to-text translations between English and other languages for immigration documents and communications; Developer Persona: Code generation in various programming languages, code documentation, unit test creation, debugging suggestions, technical documentation drafts; Security Persona: Security compliance checklists, control mapping guidance, risk assessment frameworks, security documentation templates; CFO Persona: Financial research summaries, regulatory compliance guidance, budget justification drafts, data call response templates, training material summaries.

CAD event descriptions are free-text, highly variable, and differ widely in terminology, structure, and coding practices. Because of this inconsistency, it is currently not possible to aggregate, compare, or analyze CAD data across jurisdictions at scale. MACO uses machine learning and language models to automatically classify raw CAD text into a standardized event taxonomy, enabling consistent analysis, cross-agency comparisons, and the development of national estimates of calls for service.","The AI provides standardized classifications of CAD event text, allowing BJS and partner agencies to analyze police activity consistently across jurisdictions. For BJS, this enables the production of scalable, comparable national estimates of calls for service—filling a major data gap not addressed by traditional crime measures. For state and local agencies, the standardized schema improves internal organization of CAD data and supports regional or state-level comparisons of police workload and community needs. For the research community and the public, MACO expands understanding of how law enforcement resources are used, the types of events agencies respond to, and broader patterns of community demand for police services. Overall, the tool enhances data quality, improves analytic capacity, and supports evidence-based decision-making across the criminal justice ecosystem.","The system outputs a standardized event-type classification for each CAD record. For each raw text description, the model generates a predicted category from a predefined event taxonomy (e.g., “Property Crime: Theft,” “Traffic Incident,” “Disturbance,” etc.). The final deliverable is a CAD dataset with these standardized classifications appended to each record, enabling consistent analysis and aggregation across agencies.",,,,,"The system outputs a standardized event-type classification for each CAD record.

Real-time flagging of discrepancies (e.g., inventory errors, excess sales, mismatched destruction records, possible fraudulent records) hastens the detection of potential diversion.

Frees investigators to focus on high-value investigative activities and field operations, saving thousands in costs.

Provides an auditable trail of extraction and reconciliation for internal and external audits. Maintains full audit-ready compliance for all registrants and a tangible audit trail for legal proceedings.",Outputs may be data reports to support Diversion Control Division's mission and better serve the registrant community.,,,,,Outputs may be data reports to support Diversion Control Division's mission and better serve the registrant community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This requires 8-10 hours of labor (data extraction, cleaning, cross referencing, narrative synthesis), and, since investigators analyze data in different ways, results vary. There is little  consistency across the agency or even between investigators in terms of what data is examined and there is no easy way to identify patterns such as MMEs, combinations, and early fills.","Increases operational efficiency by automating data preparation, risk identification, and initial narrative generation. Average time spent to produce a PMP decreased from ten to two hours (minus 80%).

By employing consistent, data-driven risk analysis, increases the proportion of high-value investigations that result in successful enforcement or administrative outcomes.

Reallocates Diversion Investigator effort to higher-value tasks (e.g., field operations, strategic planning), producing a labor cost benefit in the thousands per Diversion Investigator based on average pay and number of PMPs analyzed.

Faster identification of prescribing anomalies supports earlier public health interventions and reduces community exposure to diverted pharmaceuticals.

This provides more efficient use of manager review time and more consistent post-adjudication oversight by better targeting the fixed, required managerial review effort toward cases with atypical attributes that warrant a second look for quality assurance purposes. The expected benefits are improved review consistency and improved documentation of decision-making.","ARRE produces a unitless anomaly score (01) for each already-adjudicated case and uses the score to generate a post-level ranked list that bins cases into priority tiers (e.g., high/medium/low) for managerial review.

Today, users submit requests for new software or hardware, but determining whether the request duplicates existing tools, whether the technology is still supported, or whether it fits enterprise standards often depends on tribal knowledge, scattered documentation, or siloed teams. This leads to long cycle times, inconsistent risk evaluations, and limited visibility into how many licenses or subscriptions are actually in use. Organizations struggle to manage active and inactive instances across both on-premise and cloud-based environments, making it difficult to optimize costs or ensure that end-of-life and upgrade paths are handled consistently. The lack of seamless hand-offs across cataloging, approval, procurement, deployment, and monitoring workflows contributes further to inefficiency and risk.","The expected benefits of introducing AI into this process are significant. By providing automated triage and context-aware answers to common questions about request procedures and timelines, AI can shorten decision cycles and improve user satisfaction. Automated checks against enterprise standards and authoritative catalogs ensure duplication and compliance issues are caught early, while lifecycle and vulnerability monitoring reduces the chance of security exposures. Cost efficiency improves as AI correlates license usage data with actual activity, identifying inactive instances and recommending right-sizing actions. Standardized analyses and automatically generated approval packets improve auditability, while consistent tracking of end-of-life timelines and upgrade requirements reduces the likelihood of unexpected outages. Ultimately, the mission outcome is better: users gain timely access to the technologies they need, while the organization maintains governance, security, and fiscal responsibility.","The outputs of the AI system take several forms. On the conversational side, it delivers plain-language guidance about processes, expected timelines, and relevant policies. On the analytical side, it generates recommendations about whether a request is a new product, an upgrade, or already covered by an existing enterprise standard. It produces risk and readiness scores that summarize vulnerabilities, lifecycle status, duplication concerns, and cost implications. The system also generates structured artifacts such as intake forms, change analysis documents, evaluation plans, and procurement justifications that can flow directly into existing approval or tracking systems. In operations, it outputs monitoring dashboards and alerts that highlight unused licenses, upcoming end-of-life dates, or pending upgrades. Each of these outputs is designed to be human-reviewable, with citations and evidence provided to support trust and transparency.",,,,,"The outputs of the AI system take several forms.

Urgent or complex inquiries might not be identified quickly, for example, a critical contracting issue could remain unattended until staff notice it in an outlook folder, since no AI is in place to flag or escalate it based on content or sentiment. This increases the risk of SLA breaches on time-sensitive tasks and leads to program office frustration due to slow resolution. Inefficient use of resources and lost insights: In the absence of AI automation, skilled staff must continue spending a large portion of their day on mundane tasks, reading emails, categorizing tickets, data entry, instead of focusing on higher-value work. This manual workload is an inefficient use of human capital and can introduce errors or inconsistencies.

This creates barriers to accessing VA services and can result in incorrect categorization that delays or misdirects their requests.

Scale and Efficiency Problem: The VA processes over 106M inquiry records, with 35.1M completed inquiries requiring manual review and routing. Manual categorization at this volume creates significant processing delays and resource strain on both veterans submitting requests and VA staff managing the workflow.
 
Consistency and Accuracy Problem: Manual categorization leads to inconsistent classification across inquiries, with approximately 11.3M potential misclassifications identified where topics appear under multiple categories. This inconsistency results in inquiries being routed to incorrect service teams, causing delays in resolution and poor customer experience.

Resource Allocation Problem: Incorrect or inconsistent categorization prevents optimal allocation of VA staff and resources across the 18 standardized service areas (disability compensation, education benefits, healthcare, housing assistance, etc.), leading to inefficient service delivery.

The AI solution mitigates these problems by providing automated, consistent, and accurate categorization that improves both veteran experience and VA operational efficiency.","For Veterans and the General Public:

This leads to: Ongoing technical debt as well-functioning but aging middleware components require careful, phased modernization; Longer onboarding times when new developers need to interpret complex, high-value legacy code without comprehensive documentation; Resource dependencies where mid-tier developers require more direct SME involvement for certain modernization and refactoring tasks; Variation in code patterns that can affect consistency in security, performance, and maintainability across platforms; Slower adoption of modern architectures such as containerized microservices and FHIR integrations.

How AI Solves It: Explain legacy code in plain language, creating complete documentation for knowledge preservation and onboarding; Refactor code for maintainability, performance, and security, reducing technical debt; Generate standardized, efficient middleware code aligned with VA modernization goals; Produce AI-augmented unit tests to detect defects earlier (“shift-left” testing) and increase coverage; All outputs will still undergo human review, VA security scanning, and governance to ensure compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) High standards and VA TRM policy.","For the VA’s Mission: Faster code modernization – AI-assisted refactoring and generation will help transition middleware components from older platforms (MUMPS, Java, .NET Framework) to secure, containerized microservices. 
Improved developer efficiency – By automating repetitive coding & documentation tasks, developers can focus more on high-value modernization work and less on manual rework. 
Knowledge preservation – AI-generated code explanations and documentation reduce the risk of key-person dependency and improve continuity across teams.
Higher code quality  – AI-augmented unit tests and standardized patterns will strengthen maintainability and alignment with FISMA High requirements.
Accelerated delivery cycles – With AI enabling mid-tier developers to work more independently, releases can move through the DevSecOps pipeline faster while maintaining quality and compliance.
For the General Public / Veterans:
Improved reliability of VA systems – Modernized, better-tested middleware helps ensure health and benefits data flows securely and consistently.
Faster implementation of new services – Reduced development cycle times allow Veterans to benefit sooner from new integrations, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based interoperability with community care providers.
Sustained continuity of operations – Documentation and knowledge capture ensure that mission-critical systems can be maintained and improved even as staff transitions occur.","AI System Outputs

The CAPS-5 Clinician Training Simulator comprises three online courses, available in TMS and TRAIN, that provide instruction in the administration and scoring of the CAPS-5. The courses use voice recognition, 3-D technology, and artificial intelligence to create an immersive learning experience. The courses are intended for clinicians, trainees, researchers, and examiners in VA and in the community. They use AI in the following ways:
1. In the three current CAPS-5 virtual patient courses, learners have the option to speak the prompts, with their spoken prompts transformed to text using speech recognition. 
2. The learners’ prompts, whether spoken or typed, are programmatically compared to the required prompts in the CAPS-5. The system analyzes whether the prompts were delivered exactly (“verbatim”), with slight variations (“paraphrased”), or with unacceptable variations (“off-script”). 
3. One of the courses analyzes learner prompts in order to trigger comments –corrections or praise -- from a virtual coach. 
4. We’re currently revising one of the courses to take better advantage of sematic similarity to analyze learners' inputs. 
5. In the future, we may deploy generative AI. Here’s how the vendor described it in their response to our solicitation: “This new design will also leverage a separate backend to handle AI multi-agency and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ensure large language models (LLMs) used will always operate as designed.” This will be a closed system that does not pull information from or input information to publicly-available platforms (e.g., GPT-4, Bard).",Saving time and human resources that can be better deployed in patient care.

When a transcript of the patient encounter is available, SCORE employs embedding-based semantic analysis to enhance patient safety and documentation accuracy. Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that capture meaning, enabling the system to measure how semantically similar—or different—statements are between the clinical note and the source transcript.
 
This capability powers two critical safety detectors:
 
Hallucination Detection identifies factual-sounding claims in the note that lack support in the transcript. This is essential for AI-generated documentation, where models may produce plausible but ungrounded statements about medications, allergies, diagnoses, or procedures. Claims with weak transcript support are flagged with risk levels (high/medium/low) based on their potential clinical impact.
 
Contradiction Detection finds instances where the note and transcript discuss the same clinical topic but present conflicting information—such as differing medication dosages, mismatched vital signs, or inverted symptom reports (e.g., ""denies chest pain"" versus ""reports chest pain"").",Improve clinical documentation quality through standardized evaluation and scoring and create efficiency for documentation audit staff.,"Output: Quality Score & Actionable Guidance

Treatment often proves difficult when diagnosed in advanced stages - long term outcomes are significantly improved when detected early. Screening programs are underutilized and definitively lacking in specific populations 2. This includes individuals at highest risk of lung cancer including US veterans. The Dayton VA Medical Center (DVAMC) initiative is intended to aid in detection of suspicious pulmonary nodules, expedite referrals for further evaluation and improve access to timely cancer care. In patients undergoing screening CTs, approx 50% of adults will have at least one lung nodule in their lifetime 3. Tools that provide aided detection and personalized risk of development of lung cancer may identify individuals that could require additional or more frequent screening. Sybil is a deep learning model to predict future lung cancer risk from a single low-dose chest computed tomography scan (LDCT) 4. The AI model utilizes one LDCT and the assistance of a radiologist to predict the risk of a patient developing lung cancer within six years. No additional clinical data is required. It has been validated on 3 independent data sets totaling almost 30K LDCTs. When a CT is processed by the algorithm, a series of 6 numbers corresponding to the patients aggregated risk of developing lung cancer in over 6 years. The hope is Sybil will allow lung cancer screening programs to be better utilized and promote increased care for at risk populations.","When fully implemented, it can be used to personalize screening regime, calling high risk patients out earlier to identify cancers in the early stages and potentially reducing the screening burden on low risk patients.","Descriptive statistics and basic analysis will be carried out using Excel.

Healthcare providers can utilize Kettles Esophageal and Cardia Adenocarcinoma prediction tool (K-ECAN) to guide decision-making and identify potential patients who should be offered screening for EAC.","If EAC is identified at the earliest stage (intramucosal cancer without metastases), the 5-year survival with surgery is greater than 85%, and at least as good with endoscopic therapy alone. Implementation of such an intervention would bridge the gap between population-health screenings and personalized management in a manner that would minimize the impact on payer budget and resources. Since individuals are more commonly up to date for colorectal cancer screening (for instance, with colonoscopy), it is particularly suitable to harness the missed opportunity of EAC screening at the time of screening for colorectal cancer. Also, when an EAC screening with upper endoscopy is performed simultaneously with colonoscopy, it is much less expensive. This project will also serve as a roadmap for how such precision approaches to screening can be applied to other rare cancers.","The K-ECAN is an automated prediction tool for EAC that harnesses the electronic health record at the point of contact during opportune moments (such as at the time of scheduling colorectal cancer screening) to guide decision-making and identify patients who should be offered screenings for EAC.

The GPT assists the nurse by evaluating their input against the standards. The dialogue between the GPT and the nurse results in improvements in the quality of the submission. The GPTs help to recognize all the nurses' accomplishments and offer suggestions for improvement.  In the current performance process, the nurse is rated against the standards, but feedback is often lacking.  The quality of the performance report often relies on the supervisor’s writing ability and understanding of the standards.  The benefit to the supervisor is that quality content is submitted for evaluation and incorporation.  This saves both the nurse and supervisor time. The tool removes bias as it evaluates submissions against standards that are the same regardless of the submitter. This same process assists with promotion contributions.  With the dissolution of the Nursing Professional Standards Board, it directly supports frontline nurses (as per expert GPT in knowledge standards). Lastly, the Supervisor is ultimately responsible for knowing their employee and evaluating their performance. The GPT output can enhance communication; however, the decisions are solely the responsibility of the nurse supervisor (low risk to reward). The time ROI is from hours to minutes.

Providers conduct outreach to identified Veterans when appropriate. This model and the targeted prevention in which it is used (i.e. the REACH VET clinical program), is used to augment VHA's extensive clinical suicide prevention program.

Text-matching approaches are an efficient method for identifying text of interest in medical notes.  The success of text-matching approaches depends on the quality of term lists used to search for a concept of interest.  While humans can generate word lists for text-matching approaches, the generated word lists are likely to be limited and biased by the vocabulary, language habits, population exposure, and local dialects of the human generating the list.  Deep learning methods can help to augment candidate term lists to help overcome some of these challenges.  Once generated these augmented candidate terms are reviewed by subject matter experts for appropriateness and accuracy of the suggested terms for the concept and use case of interest.","Here we (1) query pre-trained large language models (e.g., ChatGPT or Llama) through a user interface that allows prompting (such as the OpenAI API or CodeLlama) and/or (2) query word and phrase “embedding” models (e.g., Word2Vec and Phrase2Vec) to expand candidate term lists for review by subject matter experts.  Our team has found both approaches effective for expediting the generation of more comprehensive term to concept mappings for use in text-matching algorithms that increase the accuracy of clinical concept extraction.   We expect this use of AI to improve initial brainstorming of terms related to a given concept, resulting in a more sensitive approach to finding information of interest in free-text clinical notes. Experience to date has found that this approach enriches term sets in ways that increase sensitivity for identification of text of interest in clinical TIU notes when used in our CLEVER natural language processing pipeline.","The outputs of this use of AI is a candidate list of terms related to a concept of interest.

A variety of approaches can be used to further filter identified text snippets to those more likely to be of interest for a given use case.  Here we use large language model queries to classify text snippets as being relevant to a concept of interest.","Improved classification of text snippets from clinical notes will increase clinician and management efficiency in use of decision support to summarize and review information extracted from free-text clinical notes.  For example, improved filtering of text snippets for clinical risk factors of interest will reduce clinician time in obtaining clinically needed information about risk factors of interest by filtering out text snippets that are unlikely to be meaningful to their immediate clinical decision.  In short, the clinician will have fewer candidate text snippets to read through to get the information they need.  Likewise, summary views of identified possible concept mentions will be more accurate, reducing noise in views to support strategic decisions.","This AI use case adds additional LLM-derived classification labels to text snippets from free-text clinical notes identified by the CLEVER NLP pipeline.  These labels indicate the LLMs classification of the text snippet as being related to a concept of interest.  For example, in our first deployed use of this method, an LLM model was used to improve classification of text snippets identified as including the term “xylazine” in the note text.  The LLM classified identified text snippets into one of three labels: (1) ""Other"" (OTH) for snippets without evidence of suspected xylazine exposure, (2) ""Suspected-Positive"" (SUS-P) for snippets with positively asserted evidence of suspected exposure, and (3) ""Suspected-Negative"" (SUS-N) for snippets where the suspected exposure was negated.  The OTH category included, for example, the many cases in which providers educated patients about the presence of xylazine in the illicit drug supply.  The LLM-derived classification labels were used to narrow down text snippets for display as mentions of “possible xylaxine exposure” on the STORM decision support display (to help clinicians find information of relevance to opioid risk management across VA medical records) and in maps of possible xylazine exposures for strategic planning.  In both cases, only those text snippets labeled as “SUS-P” were included on the displays.",,,,,"This AI use case adds additional LLM-derived classification labels to text snippets from free-text clinical notes identified by the CLEVER NLP pipeline.

These models provide realistic, global representations of the climate system, projections for hundreds of variables (including Essential Climate Variables), and combine observations from an array of satellite, airborne, and in-situ sensors. Unfortunately, direct use of this important class of data has been limited due to the large size and complexity of model output collections, internal file complexity, and limited means for dynamically creating derived products of interest. To address these limitations, we have developed an AI-based stochastic convergence technology, called MERRA/Max, that combines HPC and Princeton's Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) software to rapidly subset and identify potential drivers of change among the hundreds of variables in a climate model output collection. MERRA/Max reduces dimensionality by iteratively drawing on MaxEnt's capacity for feature selection to winnow randomly selected climate variables until a stable set of predictors is found. Preliminary work focuses on the MERRA reanalysis, a product of NASA's GEOS-5 modeling framework. At 1 petabyte in size, MERRA comprises over 700 climate variables and spans 1970 to the present at high temporal resolution.

By providing agents with high-level, lightweight information about the capabilities of other agents in the fleet, ReCAP can facilitate allocation of tasks that are dynamically discovered and assigned via an auction. Auctions are conducted for particular tasks, and agents formulate bids based on encoded subject matter expertise predicting how a given action will affect their operations. For example, one agent may request that two others bid on a sampling task. The two agents bidding may possess different instruments for sampling, one of them able to sample remotely, but at low fidelity, the other able to sample at high fidelity but requiring a physical sample be collected. The auctioneer agent will consider its own mission goals and award the task to what it deems to be the highest bid. Onboard single agents, ReCAP provides a planning/scheduling module and a behavior tree for real-time control. The planning/scheduling module includes the actions of other connected agents, so that any agent may form a plan sequence involving actions from multiple agents – this is what triggers an auction. Finally, the actions that can be executed onboard are handled by a behavior tree, which is more reactive and requires less frequent reconfiguration than a static planner.","Compared to existing multi-agent control systems, ReCAP requires no training data, before or during operations, and does not require centralized control. It was conceived alongside a NASA push for extensible mission architectures, intended to provide technology that would allow missions to interoperate as new assets are added or encountered, and to enable on-demand coordination between otherwise separate missions. ReCAP enables this capability by basing coordination on high-level, lightweight communications, and its auctioning system prevents the need for interchange of complex state information between agents. ReCAP has been deployed to success in field, laboratory, and simulated use cases across terrestrial and space applications.","Through communications interfaces, ReCAP outputs (as well as receiving) state and auction information from other agents. The behavior tree additionally outputs control commands at a level tunable to the given use case; ReCAP has been implemented with direct vehicle control, commanding velocity and position changes, as well as at a much higher level, giving commands to an existing onboard controller.",,,,,"Through communications interfaces, ReCAP outputs (as well as receiving) state and auction information from other agents.

The purpose is to enhance situational awareness, reduce manual effort, and improve response times while also enabling organizations to repurpose video data for business and safety improvements.","By leveraging AI-driven video surveillance, organizations can significantly improve efficiency and security outcomes. Automated monitoring reduces the need for constant human oversight, lowering operational costs while also decreasing the likelihood of missed incidents.

TESS telescope covers a large field of view of 96 sq. deg in a single exposure. It has four cameras arranged vertically pointing from the ecliptic plane toward the poles.,"Thanks to this configuration and observing schedule, TESS is able to observe asteroids with a high duty cycle. Current techniques to search for asteroid signals on images rely on the shift-and-stack method, which relies on testing all possible combinations of direction and speed an object can move across the image to maximize the detection signal and find the asteroid’s track. This method is computationally expensive, and only attainable when the parameter space (direction-velocity) is constrained, usually to the main direction (e.g. orbits parallel to the ecliptic plane) and low speeds (main belt asteroids). This introduces a bias against fast-moving asteroids and high-inclination orbits (vertical tracks). To solve this, we implemented a rotationally invariant neural network (NN) model that performs semantic segmentation to find moving objects in TESS FFIs.We constructed a custom training set using 64x64x64 cubes of pixel flux time series and truth masks with the tracks of known asteroids from the JPL Horizon Ephemeris system. Our NN model can find known and new asteroids with all kinds of track orientations, showing no bias against objects moving at high inclination orbits, or fast-moving asteroids, or tracks with a change in direction. This NN model detects ~90% of known asteroids down to apparent visual magnitude 20th and has a detection limiting magnitude of ~20.5. This is on par with current implementations of the shift-and-stack method but without the bias introduced by limiting the range of track direction and velocity.","This NN has an architecture that uses two 3D U-Nets stacked (W-Net) with skip connections that output a 3D segmentation mask with asteroid detections. We will introduce the NN model and present results from predictions using years 1 and 2 of TESS data.

However, moderate resolution satellite data and traditional remote sensing methods are insufficient at resolving land cover land use change in this region, which is dominated by small, dispersed patches of savanna-woodlands and smallholder agriculture systems (< 3 ha.) that consist of highly dynamic and often ill-defined field boundaries.

QUAnT enables: 1) orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost through a multi-fidelity simulation approach and the most efficient sampling techniques, 2) maximization of project resources through optimal allocation and task automation, 3) model predictive capabilities through data-driven learning (digital twins), 4) quantification of uncertainty to the maximum extent possible to efficiently identify risk drivers, 5) reliability analyses for rare events through advanced statistical methods.
QUAnT lays its foundations on state-of-the-art methodologies described in peer-reviewed literature and leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate and facilitate several tasks. It has successfully been applied to several engineering problems including flown NASA missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the ongoing Mars Sample Return, where it demonstrably brought notable savings in terms of time, cost, technical quality and efficiency.","QUAnT is expected to have a strategic, long-term, high payoff especially when used early in a project life cycle. This is advantageous as it can increase system knowledge and inform decisions when the design freedom is higher and cheaper (i.e., well before PDR, when 85% of the project’s total life cycle cost is locked in).
The anticipated ROI is tied to QUAnT’s ability to guide the mission development process while cutting down on computational cost, thus bringing notable savings in terms of time, cost and efficiency. Namely, QUAnT yields better (10%-50%) margin estimates, leading to time (<1+ year) and cost (<$200M+) savings; efficiencies in analysis cycles yield time and cost savings also thanks to the elimination of obsolete tasks and the workforce needed to perform them (as an example from a real-life case: 2.5 months, $300K for a 5-person team vs. 2 weeks, $5K for 1 person applying this technology). Finally, QUAnT is mathematically proven to provide the highest-quality results, which ensures having the best information available at hand when making decisions under uncertainty.

Modeling uncertainty is itself a “model of a model”, and one of the best datasets to describe a model’s performance is a past database of it’s predictions and after-the-fact observations. 

In this work, we develop a method based on k-NN and kernel regression to quantify uncertainty in the WSA solar wind model and it’s predictions of the solar wind speed at L1. By constructing state vectors that describe the current forecasting context— recent observations, recent predictions, and future predictions, we build a catalog of “similar scenarios” from past data. With a set of similar scenarios at each timestep, we can base our uncertainty on the performance in those cases. This approach—suitable for low-dimensional datasets such as time series—is extremely fast and interpretable.

First, we use a traditional calibration method (i.e., genetic algorithm (GA)) to calibrate soil and vegetation parameters to Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture at 25 km spatial resolution over the CONUS, Asia, and Europe. Next, we use a series of machine learning algorithms, including Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to downscale and regionalize the optimized parameters for the National Land Data Assimilation System - Phase 3 (NLDAS-3) domain (i.e., North and Central America). The goal is to develop high resolution parameters that produce a land surface model (i.e., Noah-MP) soil moisture climatology that is more in-line with SMAP’s SM climatology.","The ultimate benefit of this work is that it could improve land surface model simulations of the water cycle through more efficient remote sensing data assimilation (DA). Current DA methods rely on bias correction and CDF matching to translate observations (SMAP) into the same climatology as the model. However, this often filters out (as noise) useful signal about the human component of the water cycle, such as irrigation, in the observations. The ultimate goal of our work is to develop parameters that generate a model soil moisture climatology similar to SMAP, possibly bypassing the need for bias correction.
