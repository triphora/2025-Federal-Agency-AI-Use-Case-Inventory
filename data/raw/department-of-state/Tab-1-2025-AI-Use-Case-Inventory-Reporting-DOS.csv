The current required managerial review of cases includes a randomly selected portion, which is not optimized to help managers allocate time toward cases where secondary review is most likely to surface documentation gaps, policy-complex adjudications, or process compliance issues. As a result, managers may spend review capacity on routine cases while missing opportunities to identify coaching needs or quality issues within the fixed review window.","The primary purpose of ARRE is to support the post-adjudication, managerial quality assurance review workflow by helping managers efficiently meet existing review requirements through queue ordering and prioritization. This provides more efficient use of manager review time and more consistent post-adjudication oversight by better targeting the fixed, required managerial review effort toward cases with atypical attributes that warrant a second look for quality assurance purposes. The expected benefits are improved review consistency and improved documentation of decision-making.","ARRE produces a unitless anomaly score (0–1) for each already-adjudicated case and uses the score to generate a post-level ranked list that bins cases into priority tiers (e.g., high/medium/low) for managerial review. Outputs are advisory: managers may override or disregard the prioritization and may review any case consistent with existing authorities and review requirements. The output is used to help order the managerial quality assurance workload; it is not a decision output and is not used as an applicant risk determination. ARRE is used only after an adjudication is complete to support internal managerial oversight and does not serve as a basis for any visa eligibility determination or other binding action affecting the applicant. ARRE does not make, recommend, or change visa issuance/refusal decisions; all adjudicative determinations remain the responsibility of U.S. government officials.",01/01/2025 00:00:00,c) Developed with both contracting and in-house resources,Guidehouse, No,N/A,"ARRE was trained on a random sample of NIV application data from 2021 onward drawn from the Consular Consolidated Database.
