These foodborne outbreaks require cooperative efforts from CDC staff, FDA, USDA, and local agencies and the AI system is used through a centralized data platform System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (also known as SEDRIC). For more information on SEDRIC, please go to our website: https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne-outbreaks/php/foodsafety/tools/index.html","SEDRIC's AIP use case provides CDC epidemiologists the ability to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks by more effectively leveraging data available in a rich data source, such as receipts from grocery stores, that otherwise requires extensive time and human effort to parse through. In addition, this workflow would free up epidemiologists' time and, potentially, increase the frequency with which both CDC and STLT partners could utilize shopper card, receipts, and free text responses to support investigations. There are two main expected benefits from this use case. The first addresses manually entering receipt information, shopper card information, or other such free text field is traditionally error prone and time intensive for a variety of information. This AI system provides a human-in-the-loop opportunity to review and update data entry points while reducing time spent by staff to gain these insights. Having a set structured output as well increased standardization of this information and eases reporting in situations requiring cooperation from multiple organizations. The second benefit revolves around using the summarization capability, the extensive process of mapping common names of different food items is done automatically, greatly reducing the human labor time to generate dashboards of information regarding current foodborne investigations to serve as a decision point to aid in outbreak response.","The Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) available within SEDRIC provides CDC epidemiologists the power to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks. It can extract structured data from grocery receipts, shopper card records, and free-text responses in order to catalog the food items purchased by affected patients. It can also map those items to SEDRIC-defined vehicles which categorize the items and highlight commonalities across patients, helping to pinpoint potential outbreak vehicles. AIP can summarize these results to provide insights from information pulled from shopper receipts. Given ingredients can be found in multiple food products, and some ingredients such as herbs like coriander/cilantro may go by multiple names or be reported in multiple languages, this summarization tool provides a faster way to gather summary information from receipts on different food items which may be part of a foodborne investigation.",Oct-23,c) Developed with both contracting and in-house resources,Palantir Technologies,Yes,1 CDC Data Platform (1CDP),"Data are used in outbreak/response scenarios, such as foodborne illness outbreak response.

NCHS conducts national surveys and releases microdata (data containing information about individuals) for public use. To protect survey participants’ confidentiality, statistical disclosure limitation techniques have been used to de-identify data, but these methods have drawbacks of losing statistical properties of the original data and thus limiting useful analyses. Additionally, these methods are not designed for very large data or text data. 

Use of synthetic data may offer another option. The goal of synthetic data is to preserve essential statistical features and variable relationships of the original data such that statistical inference based on the synthetic data is close to that of the original data. 

Large language models (LLMs) may be able to address limitations of statistical methods for synthetic data creation, especially for natural language data. We aim to advance knowledge of this application of LLMs to enable staff to select the optimal tools for synthetic data generation. ","Current statistical methods for synthetic data generation have drawbacks such as difficulty handling very large datasets, steep learning curve for people with less statistics or coding background, and inability to generate natural language data.

When a single patient has more than one strain of the same pathogen (e.g. two pathogenic E. coli), the pieces of the DNA fingerprint get mixed together in the sample and make the data unusable for outbreak surveillance. Our ML-based method is intended to sort the pieces of the DNA fingerprints into separate strains and make this data usable for foodborne outbreak surveillance.","Surveillance for diarrheal foodborne outbreaks currently depends upon the availability of bacterial isolates obtained from patient stools to obtain the pathogen ""genomic fingerprints"" identifying pathogen strains. The availability of these isolates for fingerprinting is declining nationwide due to technological advancements that improve patient care. To maintain our ability to detect outbreaks without isolates, CDC is developing laboratory methods that obtain the pathogen genomic fingerprint directly from the patient stool specimen. However, patient stools frequently contain more than one strain of pathogen, so the ability to deploy these methods and maintain the sensitivity of foodborne outbreak surveillance is dependent upon development of this ML-based method to sort pathogen genomic fingerprint pieces from stool. Based on FoodNet data, we estimate that failure to implement these methods could lead to the loss of up to 75% of the samples currently captured by surveillance for some pathogens. Fewer surveillance samples will mean fewer outbreaks are detected and it will take longer to detect them, resulting in more people affected. For a sense of the scale of the challenge, NORS recorded ~300 outbreaks of Salmonella and E. coli in 2023 that were detected as a result of isolate-based surveillance. Economic impact evaluations have estimated that PulseNet surveillance alone prevents ~270,000 cases of foodborne illness in the US annually for a savings of at least $500,000,000 to the economy.","Our ML-based method 1) predicts the number of strains of a pathogen found in a single sample, 2) reports the DNA fingerprint defining each strain, and 3) gives the likelihood that two samples contain the same pathogen strain.",,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,

AI-Assisted Extraction of Circumstance Information from National Violent Death Reporting System Narratives,HHS/CDC,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,a) No,a) Pre-deployment – The use case is in a development or acquisition status.,c) Not high-impact,,Health & Medical,Natural Language Processing (NLP),"The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) compiles both quantitative and qualitative data on the circumstances surrounding violent deaths, including homicides and suicides, from three key data sources related to each death: the death certificate, the coroner/medical examiner report (including toxicology results), and the law enforcement report from the law enforcement agency that investigated the death.  

Data abstractors in state health departments across the U.S. abstract relevant information about each death from CME and LE reports, creating narratives that describe the most notable circumstances that contributed to the deaths captured in the system. Thus, much of the valuable contextual information about these deaths, such as details about chronic pain, interpersonal arguments, or other contributing factors, is embedded in free-text narratives and is not routinely abstracted into structured quantitative data fields. Manually extracting this information is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to variability. The problem we are addressing with AI is the automated extraction of specific circumstance information from these unstructured narratives, enabling more comprehensive and systematic data analysis.","Automating the extraction of circumstance information from NVDRS narratives using AI brings several important benefits. First, it significantly reduces the time required to process narrative data. While manual abstraction is resource-intensive and can take hours or days to review thousands of records, AI can accomplish this task in a matter of minutes. This efficiency is especially critical given the scale of the challenge: the NVDRS captures data on over 70,000 violent deaths annually, making manual analysis of detailed free-text information in the CME and LE narratives for each of these incidents impractical. In addition to saving time, AI improves data quality and consistency by applying uniform criteria across all records, which helps to minimize human error and variability. Furthermore, by extracting additional details, such as information about chronic pain or the presence of arguments, AI enhances the surveillance capabilities of public health officials. This richer data enables a better understanding of risk factors and circumstances surrounding violent deaths, which in turn informs more effective prevention strategies. Collectively, these outcomes directly support CDC’s mission to strengthen public health surveillance, guide prevention efforts, and ultimately reduce the incidence of violent deaths.","The AI system produces structured data outputs derived from the free-text narratives in the NVDRS.

•	Wildfire, structural, or surgical smoke 
•	Mold during post-flood remediation efforts 
•	Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis
•	Chemicals used to clean or disinfect
•	Particles liberated when cutting rock in industries such as construction and mining 
Selecting the correct respirator to protect workers requires knowledge of the hazard or hazards present, the job task, and the environment. NIOSH’s Respirator Selection Logic (RSL) is a state-of-the-art tool designed to guide the selection of appropriate respiratory protection devices based on specific workplace hazards and conditions. The RSL requires users to enter detailed, task- and environment-specific information at multiple decision points to execute its logic correctly. ","No current AI tool operationalizes the RSL while addressing the challenge of gathering and validating highly specific input information required at each decision point. The absence of such assistance leads to errors in respirator selection that can cause hazardous exposures, regulatory violations, and adverse health outcomes. Developing Ally to close this gap will improve the effectiveness of respiratory protection programs by ensuring that users supply accurate, relevant data to the RSL, thereby enhancing the quality and traceability of respiratory protection decisions aligned with established federal guidance.","Upon completion of this project, users of the RSL will be able to:
•	Receive real-time guidance on what information is required for respirator selection and why it matters.
•	Provide input in natural language rather than navigating technical documents or forms manually.
•	Understand and apply the RSL more effectively, leading to fewer errors in respirator selection, improved compliance, and stronger respiratory protection outcomes.
•	Use Ally as a decision support tool—not a decision maker—to identify and clarify required inputs, understand the rationale behind each RSL step, and access authoritative guidance. The Copilot will always keep the user in the loop, helping them apply judgment while ensuring traceability to official sources like NIOSH and OSHA.

•	Reviewing prior responses for relevance
•	Drafting a reply based on similar previous responses or researching and composing a new answer from scratch if no match is found
•	Sending response to additional staff if further subject matter expert review is needed
•	Obtaining Executive Leadership review and approval, if needed
•	Updating the spreadsheet with the finalized response, reply date, and staff who assisted with the response
This process can be time-consuming, repetitive, and inconsistent, especially when multiple team members are handling and categorizing inquiries or when there are high volumes.","The Copilot could handle the initial steps—reviewing the question, searching past responses, and drafting a reply—which currently take the most time. For straightforward or simple, repeat questions, this could reduce staff time from 30–60 minutes to under 10 minutes, with staff only needing to review and finalize the AI-generated draft.

Program officers must actively accept the assignment or refer the application to a more appropriate program officer, and they have full discretion to ignore or override the AI tool’s recommendations. The system’s output is therefore not a principal basis for any legal or binding decision; it is one of several informational inputs to an internal workflow choice made by human staff.
Second, all funding and programmatic decisions are made through established peer review and programmatic processes, governed by existing NIH/NIGMS policies and human judgment. Final funding decisions are made by the NIGMS Director in consultation with the NIGMS Advisory Council, the NIGMS Deputy Director, and the NIGMS Division Directors, not the individual program officers who manage the applications.
