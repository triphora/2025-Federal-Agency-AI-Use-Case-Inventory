For example, the system can get your unit data and run a unit commitment on it and then analyze the output. You can refine it by giving it input in English. The final product can be saved so other users can use the same instructions (it can take inputs though of dates/units, etc. that you specify so users can run it with different input each time). It will simulate having your own internal Analyst and IT resource in one.",Neither
