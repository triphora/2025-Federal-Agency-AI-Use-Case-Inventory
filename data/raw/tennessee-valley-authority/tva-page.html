  TVA Artificial Intelligence Use Case Inventory

In alignment with the Advancing American AI Act (December 2022),
Executive Order 13960: Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial
Intelligence in the Federal Government (December 2020), and applicable
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memoranda, TVA maintains a
comprehensive inventory of current and planned Artificial Intelligence
(AI) use cases. This inventory supports transparency and accountability
with both internal and external stakeholders.

By cataloging and evaluating AI use cases, TVA is better positioned to
identify and prioritize applications that enhance mission performance,
drive operational efficiency, and foster innovation. This process also
encourages the development and testing of new AI solutions aligned with
TVA’s strategic goals.

TVA actively collaborates with partners across the federal government,
academia, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector to adapt and
scale AI capabilities that support TVA’s mission and uphold its values.

As of now, TVA has not identified any AI use cases that meet the
criteria for high-impact—those that directly affect individual rights or
public safety.
