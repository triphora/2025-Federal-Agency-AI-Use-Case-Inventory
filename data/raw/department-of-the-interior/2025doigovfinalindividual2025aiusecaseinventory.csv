Each task required extensive reading, cross-checking across multiple systems, and detailed documentation. These demands strained a shrinking grants workforce, delayed internal control reviews, increased the risk of compliance failures under 2 CFR 200, and diverted staff from higher-value oversight activities. The Department needed a standardized, accurate, and scalable way to conduct internal controls testing, ensure timely eligibility checks, and complete budget reviews without overwhelming staff resources or jeopardizing compliance.","Automated analysis increased objectivity, removed inconsistencies in how staff interpreted regulatory requirements, and provided faster, more reliable information to support program decisions.

However, wildlife responses are often only investigated with respect to the footprint of infrastructure, even though human activity can strongly mediate development impacts. In Arctic Alaska, there is substantial interest in expanding energy development, raising concerns about the potential effects on barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti). While caribou generally avoid industrial infrastructure, little is known about the role of human activity in moderating their responses, and whether managing activity levels could minimize development effects. To address this uncertainty, we examined the influence of traffic volume on caribou summer space use and road crossings in the Central Arctic Herd within the Kuparuk and Milne Point oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska.",gradient-boosted machine learning models to predict hourly traffic volumes for road segments across the study and generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess effects of traffic volume on caribou fine-scale summer movements,"Prediction of liquefaction potential at input site, as it compares to existing case history dataset.
