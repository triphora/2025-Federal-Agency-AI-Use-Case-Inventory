Today, users submit requests for new software or hardware, but determining whether the request duplicates existing tools, whether the technology is still supported, or whether it fits enterprise standards often depends on tribal knowledge, scattered documentation, or siloed teams. This leads to long cycle times, inconsistent risk evaluations, and limited visibility into how many licenses or subscriptions are actually in use. Organizations struggle to manage active and inactive instances across both on-premise and cloud-based environments, making it difficult to optimize costs or ensure that end-of-life and upgrade paths are handled consistently. The lack of seamless hand-offs across cataloging, approval, procurement, deployment, and monitoring workflows contributes further to inefficiency and risk.","The expected benefits of introducing AI into this process are significant. By providing automated triage and context-aware answers to common questions about request procedures and timelines, AI can shorten decision cycles and improve user satisfaction. Automated checks against enterprise standards and authoritative catalogs ensure duplication and compliance issues are caught early, while lifecycle and vulnerability monitoring reduces the chance of security exposures. Cost efficiency improves as AI correlates license usage data with actual activity, identifying inactive instances and recommending right-sizing actions. Standardized analyses and automatically generated approval packets improve auditability, while consistent tracking of end-of-life timelines and upgrade requirements reduces the likelihood of unexpected outages. Ultimately, the mission outcome is better: users gain timely access to the technologies they need, while the organization maintains governance, security, and fiscal responsibility.","The outputs of the AI system take several forms. On the conversational side, it delivers plain-language guidance about processes, expected timelines, and relevant policies. On the analytical side, it generates recommendations about whether a request is a new product, an upgrade, or already covered by an existing enterprise standard. It produces risk and readiness scores that summarize vulnerabilities, lifecycle status, duplication concerns, and cost implications. The system also generates structured artifacts such as intake forms, change analysis documents, evaluation plans, and procurement justifications that can flow directly into existing approval or tracking systems. In operations, it outputs monitoring dashboards and alerts that highlight unused licenses, upcoming end-of-life dates, or pending upgrades. Each of these outputs is designed to be human-reviewable, with citations and evidence provided to support trust and transparency.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

","The Online Adaptive Forms team is facing significant resource constraints due to budget cuts and limited authoring staff. To meet the IRS’s need to onboard the ~100 non-tax forms in the backlog for online adaptive forms, the project team is leveraging Generative AI to streamline and accelerate the form digitalization process. The opportunities for this use case include removing the need for employees to manually create schemas for our forms, reducing the number of hours spent manually creating schemas and authoring forms, and assisting form authors by generating a first draft version of the mobile adaptive form.
